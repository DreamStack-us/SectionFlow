# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Usage

To create a changeset, run:

```bash
bun changeset
```

This will prompt you to select which packages have changed and what type of change it is (major, minor, patch).

## Configuration

The `config.json` file in this directory configures how changesets works. Key settings:

- **linked**: `@dreamstack-us/section-flow` and `sectionflow` are linked, meaning they share version numbers
- **privatePackages**: Private packages can still be versioned (for tracking changelog) but won't be tagged
- **baseBranch**: `main` is the base branch for releases

## Workflow

1. Make changes to the codebase
2. Run `bun changeset` to create a changeset describing your changes
3. Commit the changeset file along with your changes
4. When ready to release, the CI will create a "Version Packages" PR
5. Merge the PR to publish to npm
